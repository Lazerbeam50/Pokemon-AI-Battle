If move:
	- Search for move user
	- If user is foe
		- If move not in known moves, add it
			- If the known moves list is 4 items long, empty the potential moves list
			- Re-calculate checks and counters
	- Record priority bracket of move
	- Once a priority bracket has closed and has more than one pokemon in it, add pokemon to 
	speedlist in order of attacking, if they are not already in there
