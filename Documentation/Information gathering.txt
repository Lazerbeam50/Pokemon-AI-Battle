Look through move list
	- If count of unique priorities is less than the count of moves:
		- For each combination of two moves/pkmn within a priority bracket
			- Let pkmn A be the faster of the two
			- Calculate the ratio of speed scalars
			- If pkmn A has not been recorded to be faster than B before, record this
			- Otherwise, see if pkmn A has been recorded to be faster on a higher
			ratio. If so, update this info with the new ratio.

Update speed scalars based on buffs/debuffs/status/field changes
