Standard move algorithm
=======
For each move and target:

If move is a standard physical or special move which doesn't target all/allAdjacent:

Score = (type matchup * STAB * weather * abilityTarget * abilityUser * burn * screen * spread *
		invulnerable * contact * check * accuracy * buffs * status)

Else if the move is a standard physical/special move but does target all or allAdjacent:

	- Same as above but minus the score for the ally * 1.5.
	- Result must be a minimum of 0

Else, score = 100

Note: Moves like fake out, eruption and icy wind are considered non-standard

Note: Non-targeting moves are considered only once. Ally-target is not considered

Score features
--------------

Check
	- 1 + (1 * count of pokemon threatened) + (0.5 * count of pokemon walled)

Buffs
	- define userBuff as:
		- e^(attack stage/5) - 1 or e^(spA stage/5) - 1
	- define enemyBuff as:
		- e^((attack stage/5) + (spA stage/5) + (speed stage/5)) - 1

	= 1 + userBuff + enemyBuff

Status
	- If target is frozen and move type is fire, 0.05
	- Elif target is asleep or frozen, 0.75
	- Elif target is burned and has used physical moves, 0.5
	- Else 1

Switching
---------

For deciding on switch options:

1 - Compare speeds:
	- If current poke has only one opposing threat on the field, which it is faster than and
	threatens back, disincentivise switch (0.9)
	- Else if current pokemon is threatened at all, incentivise switch (3.8)
	- Else, disincentivise switch (0.9)
2 - Net buff score (more debuffs encourage a switch, more buffs discourage)
	= e**((-x)/15) where x = the sum of the stat stages
3 - Is current poke dead weight?
	- If current poke is any of the following, incentivise switch (3, else 0.9)
		- Frozen and has no thaw out moves
		- Asleep without Snore, Sleep Talk or Rest
		- Walled by both enemy pokes

4 - Switch target is not threatened or walled (1.25, else 0.5)
5 - Switch target walls at least one opponent and is not threatened by the other (1.5, else 0.9)
6 - Average defensive stats for switch target (bulker switch ins are safer pivots)
	= (e**((x - 403)/150)) * (currentHP/maxHP) where x = sum of max hp, def and spd
7 - Switch target ability bonus
	- e.g. Target has Intimidate and opponents are physical (1.5)
	- Air Lock, Cloud Nine, Damp, Drizzle, Drought, Flower Gift, Intimidate, Lightningrod, 
	Sand Stream, Snow Warning, Storm Drain, and Trace
	- Else, 1

Factors are then multiplied by 80.

Force switch
------------

When deciding on a forced switch:

	- Randomly select between the pokemon which threatens the most of the opponent's current 
	pokes on the field, and is not threatened by either of them. Bonus points if it walls them 
	and is not walled.

Cross join and Synergy Adjustment
---------------------------------

The AI then creates a cross join of each Pokémon's options, removing the only impossible option 
(both pokes switching to the same target).

Some versions of this AI should apply a synergy adjustment, incentivising combinations like 
Earthquake + Protect and penalising combinations like Earthquake + Switch into vulnerable Pokémon

The AI finally chooses randomly between the joint highest combos (assuming some are joint first).

Move voting
-----------

More random versions of the AI should create votes proportional to the score of each vote and choose 
one at random.

Team preview
------------

For team preview:

Iterate through a cross-list of AI and opposing pokes:
	- For each combination, you will have a Poke A and a Poke B:
		- Poke A is considered to be threated by Poke B if Poke B's best move has at least
		a 2x multiplier
		- Poke A is considered to be walled by Poke B if Poke A's best move has less
		than a 1x multiplier

- Make a list of the opponent's pokemon
- While the AI's shortlist contains less than 3 pokemon:
	- Select the the AI pokemon which threatens the most pokemon (considering only unthreatened
	opponents). 
	- If more than one pokemon threated the same number of pokemon, randomly select between the 
	ones which wall the most pokemon.
	- Remove threatened opposing pokes from the list.

For leads, prioritise pokes who can set up first:
	- Fake out
	- Speed control
	- Intimidate
	- Weather control
	- Screens
	- Will-o-wisp
After that (or as a tiebreaker) prioritise the pokemon which threaten the most pokemon. Finally, 
prioritise the fastest pokemon.

Once the four pokemon are selected, set up speed relationships for each pair. Calculate the min/
max ratios need to be faster or slower.
