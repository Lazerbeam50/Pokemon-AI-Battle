Standard move algorithm
=======
For each move and target:

If move is a standard physical or special move which doesn't target all/allAdjacent:

Score = (type matchup * STAB * weather * abilityTarget * abilityUser * burn * screen * spread *
		invulnerable * contact * check * accuracy * buffs * status)

Else if the move is a standard physical/special move but does target all or allAdjacent:

	- Same as above but minus the score for the ally * 1.5.
	- Result must be a minimum of 0

Else, score = 100

Note: Moves like fake out, eruption and icy wind are considered non-standard

Note: Non-targeting moves are considered only once. Ally-target is not considered

Score features
--------------

Check
	- 1 + (1 * count of pokemon checked) + (0.5 * count of pokemon countered)

Buffs
	- define userBuff as:
		- e^(attack stage/5) - 1 or e^(spA stage/5) - 1
	- define enemyBuff as:
		- e^((attack stage/5) + (spA stage/5) + (speed stage/5)) - 1

	= 1 + userBuff + enemyBuff

Status
	- If target is frozen and move type is fire, 0.05
	- Elif target is asleep or frozen, 0.75
	- Elif target is burned and has used physical moves, 0.5
	- Else 1

Switching
---------

For deciding on switch options:

1 - Compare speeds:
	- If current poke has only one opposing check on the field, which it is faster than and
	checks back, disincentivise switch (0.9)
	- Else if current pokemon is checked at all, incentivise switch (3.8)
	- Else, disincentivise switch (0.9)
2 - Net buff score (more debuffs encourage a switch, more buffs discourage)
3 - Is current poke dead weight?
	- If current poke is any of the following, incentivise switch (3, else 0.9)
		- Frozen and has no thaw out moves
		- Asleep without Snore, Sleep Talk or Rest
		- Countered by both enemy pokes

4 - Switch target is not checked or countered (1.25, else 0.9)
5 - Switch target counters at least one opponent and is not checked by the other (1.5, else 0.9)
6 - Average defensive stats for switch target (bulker switch ins are safer pivots)
7 - Switch target ability bonus
	- e.g. Target has Intimidate and opponents are physical
	- Air Lock, Cloud Nine, Damp, Drizzle, Drought, Flower Gift, Intimidate, Lightningrod, 
	Sand Stream, Snow Warning, Storm Drain, and Trace

Factors are then multiplied by 80.

Force switch
------------

When deciding on a forced switch:

	- Randomly select between the pokemon which check the most of the opponent's current pokes 
	on the field, and is not checked by them. Bonus points if it counters them and is not
	countered. 

Cross join and Synergy Adjustment
---------------------------------

The AI then creates a cross join of each Pokémon's options, removing the only impossible option 
(both pokes switching to the same target).

Some versions of this AI should apply a synergy adjustment, incentivising combinations like 
Earthquake + Protect and penalising combinations like Earthquake + Switch into vulnerable Pokémon

The AI finally chooses randomly between the joint highest combos (assuming some are joint first).

Move voting
-----------

More random versions of the AI should create votes proportional to the score of each vote and choose 
one at random.

Team preview
------------

For team preview:

Iterate through a cross-list of AI and opposing pokes:
	- For each combination, you will have a Poke A and a Poke B:
		- Poke A is considered to be checked by Poke B if Poke B's best move has at least
		a 2x multiplier
		- Poke A is considered to be countered by Poke B if Poke A's best move has less
		than a 1x multiplier

- Make a list of the opponent's pokemon
- While the AI's shortlist contains less than 3 pokemon:
	- Select the the AI pokemon with the most checks (considering only unchecked opponents). 
	- If more than one pokemon have the most checks, randomly select between the ones with the
	most counters
	- Remove checked opposing pokes from the list.

For leads, prioritise pokes who can set up first:
	- Fake out
	- Speed control
	- Intimidate
	- Weather control
	- Screens
	- Will-o-wisp
After that (or as a tiebreaker) prioritise the pokemon with the most checks. Finally, prioritise
the fastest pokemon.
